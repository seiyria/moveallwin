# moveallwin
A small autohotkey script to move all windows to the next monitor (rotating back to the beginning as necessary)

# why?
There was nothing out there to rotate all of my windows one monitor in either direction as desired, so this script came into existence. My neck will thank me later.

# utilization

Either download the script from github, or download the release from the releases page and run that. Hotkeys are:

* Left Win + Alt + Left Arrow - move all windows one monitor to the left
* Right Win + Alt + Right Arrow - move all windows one monitor to the right

# caveats

* your monitors (probably) all have to be the same size
* it does not move minimized or windows fullscreen windows
* it does an unnecessary swap, and it looks kinda ugly
